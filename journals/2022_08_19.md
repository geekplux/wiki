But I don’t really work that way, and I’ve come to use a really small set of tools and libraries for all of my projects. As a benefit of using a consistent set of tools, I’ve come to know all the tools I use *very well*. If anything goes wrong, chances are, I’ve probably seen and solved the problem before, and I can probably fix it with a single Google search at most.
