- > Twitter is like poetry: Treat every tweet like a Japanese haiku. Nail the look and the rhythm. The images, the formatting, and the context you set at the beginning. Every word counts, just like a poem.
  > Tweet about one thing: Every tweet should be about just one idea, no matter how long it is. Start with a simple sentence. Then elaborate. When you keep the idea simple, your tweet can be long but people will still read it.
  > Respect your readers: Take your audience seriously. Write the kinds of tweets you’d like to see. Pay attention to the tweets that annoy you and add them to the forbidden list. Be kind. Don’t be spammy by using a dozen hashtags. Improve the experience for your readers, and they will follow you.
