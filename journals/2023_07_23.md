			- > When we satisfy our desire to certify the moment with a Tweet, or a Story, or a text to a friend, or a TikTok video, we sell it short. We reduce the experience to a single, throwaway-able moment, swiped by in a second, and we set the moment free. Even worse, we leave our experience (just born, fragile and fresh) in the hands of others who may not treat it with respect
			- > By refusing that initial instinct to share and move on, we allow ourselves to pass into the moment. Only then do we actually, fully "capture" it. We receive our experience, we become part of it, we live.
			- 感受美的那一刻，而不是捕捉它并分享到社交平台上
