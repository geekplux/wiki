			- > You manage processes; you lead people
			  > 
			  > You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person's authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed
			  Additionally, you are leading people by example and through empathy.
			  They have goals, fears and motivations. Frequently also problems outside of work.
			  Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed.
