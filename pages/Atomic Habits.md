- ### "identity-based habits"
	- instead of reaching the target, become the type of person who has this habit.
	- > Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
	- To a large degree, your identity emerges out of your habits. It’s like a self-improvement feedback loop. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. And the more you reinforce the identity, the more natural it will feel to repeat the behavior.
- ### “Two-Minute Rule.”
	- > When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
- ### "Design Your Environment"
	- > If you want to remember to read a book instead of looking at your phone every time you’re bored, set your phone’s lock screen photo to be a photo of the book you’re trying to finish.
	  > If you want to remember to go for a run every morning, lay out your workout clothes and shoes the night before.
