  I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow 
  I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  
  I do not make any of my own clothing.  
  I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  
  I did not discover the mathematics I use.  
  I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  
  I am moved by music I did not create myself.  
  When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  
  I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  
  I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
