		  > Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:
		  * Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.
		  * Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.
		  * Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.
		  * Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.
		  * Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.
		  * Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).
