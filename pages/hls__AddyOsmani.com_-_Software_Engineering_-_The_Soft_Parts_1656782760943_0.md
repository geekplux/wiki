- The fundamentals are the foundation of any software engineering career. There are two layers to them - macro and micro. The macro layer is the core of software engineering and the micro layer is the implementation (e.g. the tech stack, libraries, frameworks, etc.).

- When picking new skills to learn or use, don't be afraid to choose something that's boring and not in the news. FOMO may not be productive when it comes to technology whether it be languages, frameworks, and libraries and tools.

- When debugging, you should try to resolve the issues systematically and rigorously to address all the test conditions. Always read the error messages (and the stack trace). There's likely valuable information in there that will help you isolate the problem so you can resolve it.

- When talking to a business person, talk about the business impact of what you are doing. Avoid using overly technical jargon. When talking to engineering management, communicate the technical impact or challenges. When talking with a decision-maker, you describe available options and their implications and risks, not the details of how the options work. When providing a status update, be aware of what else has transpired and how your update is relevant to the project goals.
