- Why Carbon Fiber? 
  store energy -> energy return -> boost
  #running
- > The goal of using carbon fiber plates in athletic shoes is rooted in the idea of **improving energy return**, particularly at the “toe-off,” or where an athlete’s toe pushes off the ground. The carbon fiber plate is shaped with a curve at the arch that bends slightly downward under the ball of the foot. The intent is to store energy when the heel strikes the ground and release the athlete’s own energy back to them at the toe-off, **giving a boost**.
